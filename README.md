### Description

A functional and nearly complete iPod clone. Contains the iPod's media databasing features, nearly complete replica of the menu system, 3 of the 4 gen3 games. A remote for a minituraized GUI. An exact replcia of the button/thumbwheel interface. And near exact replica of the LCD font. Switched to a smaller screenshot/mosaic, added double buffering, battery icon will show your actual battery status if you're using a laptop. Fixed some solitaire bugs, implemented the ability to change options. Started a game profile. Has blackjack, hopefully no more ghost menus. Parashoots can now be shot out without killing the paratrooper. Can read iPod notes. Added music trivia game
