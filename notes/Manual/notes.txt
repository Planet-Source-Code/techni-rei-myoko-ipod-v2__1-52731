<TITLE>Reading Notes</TITLE>My clone reads very simple, perfectly formed HTML (to my standards), using aTitle.txt as the index.html. Why? Apple is weird. For the purpose of not testing my HTML parser, () are the brackets HTML uses. The only tags recognised are TITLE, BR, P, and A. You can not close tags other than TITLE and A or the text inside will be ignored. Underlined text are hyperlinks linking to some other page. Clicking them executes the link. Use the scroll wheel to select a line.<P>A history is kept, use the rewind and forward buttons to go back and forward
