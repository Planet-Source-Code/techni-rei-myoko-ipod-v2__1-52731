<TITLE>Media Database</TITLE>This iPod, much like the real one, keeps a database of your files. Unlike the real iPod which requires a computer to edit it's database, my iPod does it itself. The first time you play a song, it will be scanned of its ID3v1 tags and added to the database. The database allows you to browse by Album, Genre, and Artist. As well as by a master song list, and a directory hierarchy. The database also keeps track of a few other things, like the position of the main window and the remote, your options, high scores, and amount of cash in yor profile.<P>
Non gambling games simply add $10 to your profile when you beat your old high score. Gambling games add or take away when you win or lose. It doesnt really matter if you are in the negative, it'll just mean you're bad at the games.<P>Please do not edit the database file yourself.<a href="aTitle.txt">Back</a>
