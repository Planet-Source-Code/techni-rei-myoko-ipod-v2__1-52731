<TITLE>Playing President</TITLE>This is a slightly more complex game, but very, very fun when mastered<B>The first hand of President is the establishing hand. This will decide who is the President, Vice Pres, Vice Bum, and the Bum for the next round.<B>7 cards are dealt to each player. The rank of the cards is as follows (most powerful to least powerful) 2, A, K, Q, ... 4, and 3<B>For the first round you are the president, and are choosen to go first and they play a card, the next person has two options<B>to play a card higher than (but not the same) as the previous card<B>or to pass on that turn. <B>For example, if a 4 is lead, a next player must play HIGHER than a 4, the the next player has to play higher than that. A new hand starts when all players pass, or when someone plays a 2 (the most powerful card). The last person to play a card, leads the next hand.<B>This proceeds until all players are rid of their cards. The first player out of cards is the Pres for the next round, the next out becomes the VP, the next player out is the Vice Bum, and the last person out is the Bum.<B>However lets say that the person leading has two 5's, this person may play them both, then the next player must play two of the same card HIGHER than five. This player cannot play one card or three cards, only two. The only time a player may lay one card in a situation like this is if it is a two (the power card), a single two, beats everything, except more 2's. If 2's are placed already, you msut place more 2's that that which was placed. And the hand ends followed by a new lead.<B>If you pass you are given a card
