<TITLE>Playing Brick</TITLE>Brick is the first multitasking game I ever made. I tried tetris in Pascal but gave up. (In programming terms, thats pathetic) The objectof the game is remove all the blocks on screen by hitting them with the ball. How do you control the ball? You don't, you keep it moving by moving the small platform with the scroll wheel, to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen. When you fail to stop it you lose a life, when you lose all of them, you lose and have to start over.<P>
You can change the speed of my multitasking games by using the rewind or fast forward buttons. Play should pause the game too<P>
Also, the ball tends to speed up or slow down if the direction of the platform is going or opposes the ball's direction<a href="aTitle.txt">Back</a>
