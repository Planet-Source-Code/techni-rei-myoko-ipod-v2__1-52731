Using these stats, you have to determine whether or not the house is worth robbing<BR>The highest security rating is 10, but the random number that determines if you robbed the house goes up to 12.<BR>If the number is greater than the security rating, you successfully robbed the house of its loot.<BR>If the number is the same, then you escaped and got nothing.<BR>If the number is lower then you got caught and lose $500<BR>	Honour is calculated based on the security rating (the higher the better), the age	(the lower the better), Is home (if they aren't, the better) and Class (the higher the better)<a href="aTitle.txt">Back</a>
