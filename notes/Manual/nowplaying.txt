<title>Playing a song</title>You'll be seeing a lot of this mode.
In the upper left hand corner will be a number like '3 of 20'. The 3 is the current track position in a queue of 20.
In the upper right corner is the shuffle and repeat indicators, shuffle doesn't do anything.
Some ID3v1 info fills the majority of the screen, then the time bar with the current position, and time remaining beneath it.
The controls operate just like they should here. Play pauses and resumes, forward goes ahead a track, rewind back one.
If the time bar is showing, the scroll wheel will allow you to seek to a different second in the track playing.
If the time bar is not showing, the scroll wheel will let you change the current tracks rating out of 5 stars.
To hide/show the time bar, click the select button<a href="aTitle.txt">Back</a>
