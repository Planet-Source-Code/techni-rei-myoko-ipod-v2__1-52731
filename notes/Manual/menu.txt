<title>Using the Menu</title>The menu system is fairly easy to get the hand of. The wheel moves your selected item up and down. The select button tells the iPod that you've choosen the select item. If the selected item has a '>' on the right side, it leads to another layer of menus. Some have other text on the right side which changes when you select it, those are options that change the way the iPod operates.
